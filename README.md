# Web Scraping NHL Data for Prediction using MachineLearning

<b> Project Background</b>: Using data from the 2017-2018 & 2018-2019 NHL Seasons, I will train a Machine Learning model to predict the games (at least the ones completed before quarantine) for the 2019-2020 season. This Project will be completed in two different parts - Web Scraping (data collection) and Predicting using Machine Learning. My model will learn based on the aggregated stats of a given team, at any time in a season, before the scheduled outcome occurs. Using the Rvest package, I will create a web scraper to gather all the data I can from each NHL game for each season. At the time of writing, I'm exclusively using hockey-reference.com for this data. Once my data is pulled, the stats from each game include: Date of the game, Home Team, Away Team, Result (training only - reflects Home Team), Home Goals, Home Shots, Away Goals, Home PIM, Away PIM, Away Shots, Home Corsi (all situations), Away Corsi, Home Offensive Zone Start %, Away Offensive Zone Start %, Home Hits, Away Hits, Home Blocked Shots, Away Blocked Shots, Game Length (Regulation, Overtime, or Shootout), Empty_Netters, Home Save %, Away Save %, Home Shooting %, Away Shooting %, Home SPSV%/PDO, Away SPSV%/PDO, Home Goals Against, Away Goals Against, Home Differential, Away Differential, Home Wins, Away Wins, Home Shots Against, Away Shots Against, Home Points and Away Points. Prediction results will depend on whether it was the home or away team that won the game. There will be some other factors that I may eventually include in my model such as: Last 10 games Win % again Opponent, Faceoffs, and Health (mainly a subjective factor). I may or may not enter these factors right away depending on where I'm at with my Project's deadlines. Iâ€™ll also need to gather all of the roster information from the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 seasons for team improvement comparisons to be used in the first game for each team.
